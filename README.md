## Editing
 In this html, css and Javascript structure a functional password generator was created. Writing and editing a majority of the code in Javascript.  
 
 In this instance, I was troubleshhotings various ways to make the button generate anything. 
 However, this problem was solved using strings. 

 Steps:
 1. Began generating alerts, prompts and confirm statments.
 2. Created constants 
 3. Linking html button id with javascript
 4. Moved onto creating functions, variables and console log
 5. Placed a string into a function to combine variables for randomness
 6. Used more variables and introduced for loops
 7. Comments were also applied in pseudo code
 8. Created branches to add, commit, push and merge to git hub
