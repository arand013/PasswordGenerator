* GIVEN I need a new, secure password
1. WHEN I click the button to generate a password 
* THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
2. WHEN prompted for password criteria
* THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
3. WHEN prompted for the length of the password
* THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
4. WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
* THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
5. WHEN I answer each prompt
* THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
6. WHEN all prompts are answered
* THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
7. WHEN the password is generated
* THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Editing
 In this html, css and Javascript structure a functional password generator was created. Writing and editing a majority of the code in Javascript.  
 
 In this instance, I was troubleshhotings various ways to make the button generate anything. 
 However, this problem was solved using strings. 

 Steps:
 1. Began generating alerts, prompts and confirm statments.
 2. Created constants 
 3. Linking html button id with javascript
 4. Moved onto creating functions, variables and console log
 5. Placed a string into a function to combine variables for randomness
 6. Used more variables and introduced for loops
 7. Comments were also applied in pseudo code
 8. Created branches to add, commit, push and merge to git hub
